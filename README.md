- 👋 Hi, I’m Revanth Srinivas (@Reva-Kovuru)
- 👀 I’m very interested in translating thoughts to working tools using the power of programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# along with Unity Engine _(just as a challenge to see if i could create a decent game)_ and I'm also into Machine Learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **Python** or **Java** based projects. 
- 📫 Here is my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/revanthsrinivaskovuru/) account. Feel free to text me!!
